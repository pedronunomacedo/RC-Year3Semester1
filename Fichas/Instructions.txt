2) Paste the following command in order to crete two serial ports and establish the connection between them.

3) Open another terminal in the lab directory and compile the .c file (i.e., gcc -o <filename>.c filename)
   -> This corresponds to the writer.

4) In the same terminal, write "./<filename> dev/ttys001". NOTE: Here the filename is the executable, not 
   the .c file, so it does ot end with any termination

5) Open another terminal in the lab directory and compile the .c file (i.e., gcc -o <filename>.c filename)
   -> This corresponds to the reader.

6) In the same terminal, write "./<filename> dev/ttys002". NOTE: Here the filename is the executable, not the .c file, so the one that does not end with any termination
